					<td>Rocket League</td>

					<td>10/10</td>
					<td>20hrs</td>
					<td>The only thing stopping us from using this as a default is the agreement on
						game and the inability to play it solo. Lots of games made by others to
						play. Current favorite... Splendor</td>

					<td>Minion Masters</td>
					<td>8/10</td>
